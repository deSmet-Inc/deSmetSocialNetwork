<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

deSmet is a new generation social network with biometric authentication through Passkey. We have collected all the best and most advanced security technologies to provide IOS users with the best experience compared to other social networks.

Here's why:
* Passkey. Thanks to the Passkey, there is no need to register with an email or phone number. You can no longer be hacked through phishing ads and will not be exposed to spam calls
* No bots or spam. Since registration is only available through biometrics, no bot will be able to get into the social network, which means you will no longer receive unnecessary offers or spam
* Data protection. There is no way we can get your data to share it with third parties, moreover, we will not litter your feed with tons of personalized ads, instead we use a subscription model

We are constantly making adjustments, integrating new technologies and listening to users. By choosing us, you are choosing the safest and most honest social network on the market. Together we can show the mercantile and stagnant giants where their real place is
